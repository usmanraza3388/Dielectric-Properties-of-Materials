# Dielectric-Properties-of-Materials

Dielectric materials are fundamental to modern electronics, powering everything from energy storage capacitors to tunable microwave devices. However, discovering optimal dielectric materials remains a complex task due to the intricate interplay between atomic structure, chemistry, and electronic behavior.

With the power of materials informatics, we can decipher these relationships and accelerate the discovery of efficient dielectric materials tailored to specific applications.

This notebook demonstrates how we can combine data, machine learning, and domain knowledge to accelerate the discovery of novel dielectric materials.
